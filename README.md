# Super-Memorizer-Helper (Under Development)
The successor of the highly inefficient original memorizer helper, made to make memorizing easy
# Changes From The Original
I plan to add the following:
  * The most important change is the change from PySimpleGUI to Tkinter. Due to PySimpleGUI's very high level library, I found         difficulities trying to fit any of my ideas. Plus the new key system is very annoying and I'm happy I learned tkinter before they made that change
  * Replace the floppy text saving system by an csv-type save system that will allow for all-around editing
  * Instead of every lesson only having one entry, I plan to have every lesson consist of many segments with side notes
  * New UI! Replacing the old pale green UI is something I'm absolutely looking forward to
  * The original memorizer helper code was... not so great, so I'm planning to change that in this one

# Thanks for noticing my niche project <3
